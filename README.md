# ClipStudio

A personal media notebook web app for saving videos with rich-text notes — like Evernote, but for videos. Supports downloading from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms via yt-dlp.

## Features

- **Notebooks & Chapters** — Organize content into notebooks with named chapters
- **Video Entries** — Download videos locally and write notes alongside them
- **Timestamped Transcription** — Transcribe videos with per-segment timestamps using Whisper
- **Video Trimming** — Trim by start/end timestamps; original preserved, new entry created
- **Scene Splitting** — Detect scene changes using in-browser perceptual hashing
- **Semantic Search (RAG)** — Build a search index from transcripts, search by meaning
- **Bulk Download** — Download multiple videos at once into named folders
- **Rich Text Editor** — Bold, italic, lists, and headings via Quill.js
- **Fully Local** — No cloud, no accounts. Everything stays on your machine

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Python

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download **Python 3.10 or newer**
3. **Windows:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during install

### Step 2: Download & Run

1. [**Download ZIP**](https://github.com/artificialnouveau/clipstudio/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it
2. **Mac:** Double-click **`install_and_run.command`**
3. **Windows:** Double-click **`install_and_run.bat`**

The script installs everything (including Homebrew + ffmpeg on Mac) and opens the app. First launch takes a few minutes.

> **Mac: Terminal will ask for your password.** The installer needs your Mac login password (typed, not visible) to install Homebrew and ffmpeg. This is normal — it uses `sudo` for system-level installs. You only need to do this on the first run.

> **Mac: "Cannot verify" warning?** macOS may block the file the first time. To fix:
> 1. Click **Done** (not Move to Trash)
> 2. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security**
> 3. Scroll down — you'll see the blocked file with an **Open Anyway** button
> 4. Click it and confirm
>
> Alternatively, right-click the file and choose **Open** instead of double-clicking. You only need to do this once.

After first install, use **`ClipStudio.command`** (Mac) or **`.bat`** (Windows) for quick launch.

## Usage Guide

### Sidebar — Notebooks & Chapters

Use the sidebar to switch notebooks, create chapters, and search.

![Sidebar](screenshots/08_sidebar.png)

- **Notebook dropdown** — switch, create (+), rename, delete notebooks
- **Chapters** — click to open, drag to reorder, hover for rename/delete
- **Search** — keyword search across all notes and titles
- **Bulk Download** — open the bulk download view

### Chapter View

Select a chapter to see its entries, notes, and tools.

![Chapter View](screenshots/02_chapter_view.png)

- **Toolbar** — "Transcribe All" transcribes every entry; "Build Index for RAG" creates semantic search index
- **Chapter Notes** — rich-text editor for general chapter notes
- **Folder path** — shown at the top so you know where files are saved on disk

### Adding Videos

Paste a video URL and click Download & Save. A progress bar shows while downloading.

![Add Entry](screenshots/04_add_entry.png)

Supports YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, Reddit, Vimeo, and [1000+ sites](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md).

### Entry Cards

Each entry shows the video, notes editor, and action buttons.

![Entry Card](screenshots/03_entry_card.png)

- **Trim** — enter start/end timestamps to extract a clip (original is preserved)
- **Split Scenes** — detect and save scene changes
- **Transcribe** — generate a timestamped transcript
- **Save Notes** — persist your rich-text notes

### Transcription

Click **Transcribe** on any entry. The transcript appears in a dedicated section with timestamps like `[0:00 - 0:15] Hello world...`. Click **Transcribe All** to process every entry in the chapter.

### Scene Splitting

Click **Split Scenes** on an entry to open the scene detection modal.

![Scene Splitter](screenshots/06_scene_splitter.png)

1. Adjust **sensitivity** (lower = more scenes) and **sample interval**
2. Click **Detect Scenes** — frames are analyzed in-browser
3. Preview scenes with thumbnails and transcript excerpts
4. **Save** individual scenes, selected scenes, or all at once — each becomes a new entry

### Semantic Search (RAG)

1. **Transcribe** your videos first (the index is built from timestamped transcripts)
2. Click **Build Index for RAG** in the toolbar
3. A search box appears — type a query like "protest movements" or "economic impact"
4. Results show the video title, time range, transcript excerpt, and relevance score (0-1, closer to 1 = more related)
5. Click **Trim & Save** on any result to extract that clip as a new entry

Rebuild the index after adding or transcribing new videos.

### Bulk Download

Click **Bulk Download** in the sidebar.

![Bulk Download](screenshots/07_bulk_download.png)

1. Enter a folder name and paste URLs (one per line)
2. Optionally check "Transcribe after download"
3. Click **Download All** — progress bar tracks each download
4. Use **Build Index for RAG** and **Transcribe All** on downloaded folders

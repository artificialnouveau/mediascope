# Digital Culture Notebook

A personal media notebook web app for saving videos with rich-text notes — like Evernote, but for videos. Supports downloading from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms via yt-dlp.

## Features

- **Notebooks** — Create multiple notebooks, each with its own set of chapters
- **Chapters** — Organize content into named chapters within a notebook, each with its own rich-text notes. Reorder chapters with drag-and-drop or arrow buttons
- **Video Entries** — Paste a URL, download the video locally, and write notes alongside it
- **Transcription** — Transcribe any video using Whisper (faster-whisper). Transcribe individual entries or all entries in a chapter at once. Already-transcribed entries are automatically skipped
- **Rich Text Editor** — Bold, italic, lists, and headings via Quill.js
- **Search** — Keyword search across all notes and video titles
- **Organized File Storage** — Videos and notes saved in `media/Notebook_Name/Chapter_Name/` with clean filenames
- **Fully Local** — No cloud, no accounts. Videos and notes stay on your machine

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Python

If you don't have Python installed yet:

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download and install **Python 3.10 or newer**
3. **Windows users:** During installation, check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** — this is important!

*(Mac users: Python 3 may already be installed. The launcher will tell you if it's missing.)*

### Step 2: Download the App

1. Click this link: [**Download ZIP**](https://github.com/artificialnouveau/digital_culture_notebook/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Unzip the downloaded file (double-click it)

### Step 3: Run the App

**Mac:**
- Open the unzipped folder and double-click **`install_and_run.command`**
- If macOS says the file can't be opened: right-click it, choose **Open**, then click **Open** again

**Windows:**
- Open the unzipped folder and double-click **`install_and_run.bat`**

That's it! The script automatically installs everything needed — including **Homebrew** and **ffmpeg** if they're missing (Mac) — and opens the app in your browser. The first launch takes a few minutes while dependencies install.

> **Windows note:** ffmpeg is not auto-installed on Windows. If the script warns about it missing, download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and [add it to PATH](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows). Without ffmpeg, video downloading still works but trimming and transcription won't.

To stop the app, close the terminal window or press `Ctrl+C`.

### Running it again later

After the first install, use the quick launcher instead:

- **Mac:** Double-click **`Digital Culture Notebook.command`**
- **Windows:** Double-click **`Digital Culture Notebook.bat`**

**Tip:** Drag this file to your Dock (Mac) or right-click and choose "Pin to Taskbar" / "Create shortcut on Desktop" (Windows) for easy access.

## Advanced: Manual Setup

If you prefer to set things up yourself:

## Notes

- Videos are stored locally in `app/media/` and served by the backend
- The database (`notebook.db`) is auto-created on first run
- For age-restricted or login-gated videos, the downloader attempts to use cookies from your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Transcription uses the `base` Whisper model by default. The model is downloaded automatically on first use (~150MB). Edit `transcriber.py` to change the model size (e.g. `small`, `medium`, `large-v3` for higher accuracy)
